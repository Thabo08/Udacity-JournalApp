### This app is used for creating and managing diary entries. ###

#### The Journal App works in the following manner: ####
1.  The user signs in to the app using his/her Google account.
2.  Upon signing in, the user gets taken to the screen that allows them to add a diary entry. See "Diary Entry Screen.png" in screenshots directory.
3.  When the user clicks the 'Add' button, a screen prompting them to enter a diary entry title and the details of that entry gets launched.
    See "Diary Entry Screen" in screenshots directory.
4.  In this view, the user can add values and click the 'SAVE' button when done. See "Diary Entry Screen with Entries" in screenshots directory.
5.  Upon hitting the 'SAVE' button, the user gets returned to the original screen. Here the new diary entry will be displayed
    by showing it title and the date and time it was added. See "Main Screen With Entries" in the screenshots directory.
6.  By repeating steps 3 to 5, multiple entries can be added in same way and yield the same display.
7.  To view more details about an entry, the user can just click on the entry. See "Entry Detail" in screenshots directory.
8.  This view also allows the user to edit the entry. This is done by clicking the edit button. See "Edit Screen" in screenshots directory.
9.  Upon clicking the edit button, the user gets taken to the same view as in step 4, with the 'SAVE' button changing to 'MODIFY'.
10. Clicking the 'MODIFY' button will return the user to the "Entry Detail" screen, showing newly edited entries.
11. An entry can be deleted by the user by clicking on it, holding and then swiping it to the right.

The display of the entries is ordered by their insert/modification timestamp. For example, if initially "Entry 10" was added after 'Entry 1' and
th user modifies 'Entry 1', this entry will now appear above 'Entry 10'.
